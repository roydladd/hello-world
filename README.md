# hello-world
My first personal GitHub repository!
I am a former professional Jazz saxophonist, now aspiring to become a developer. 
I have developed a great interest and passion for coding, as well as unearthing the inner 
workings of technology I have been amazed by since childhood. Creating this is one step further toward illumination.
